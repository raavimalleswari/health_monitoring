# health_monitoring
**Personalized Health Monitoring and Risk Prediction System**
**Project Overview**
This project is a data-driven health monitoring and risk prediction system built using Python. It uses patient health data (e.g., age, cholesterol, heart rate, blood pressure) to:
1.Clean and preprocess health records
2.Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.Engineer new features for better prediction
4.Train a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest)
5.Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance
6.Generate automated health reports
The goal is to help identify potential heart-related risks using machine learning and visualization techniques.
**Features**
1.Data Integration & Preprocessing
2.Load dataset (heart.csv)
3.Handle missing values
4.Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler
5.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6.Visualize feature distributions
7.Correlation heatmap of features
8.Feature Engineering
9.Create new features such as age_squared
10.Time Series Analysis
11.Plot trends over time for selected features
12.Supervised Machine Learning
13.Train/test split
14.Train Random Forest Classifier
15.Evaluate with accuracy score & classification report
16.Reporting
**Generate summary statistics (summary.csv)
Save results in reports/ directory**
**Tech Stack**
1.Python
2.Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
